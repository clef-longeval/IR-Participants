This repository contains the information for the teams participating in the [CLEF LongEval](https://clef-longeval.github.io/) Task 1. LongEval-Retrieval.

The repository is organised as follows:

Submissions: This folder is used to contain information about the submissions.\
Scores: This folder will contain the performance scores of the submitted runs.\
Resources: This folder contains the resources needed for doing the submissions.

There are two sub-tasks organized in LongEval-Retrieval. Each team can participate in one or both subtasks.

**Sub-task A, short-term persistence.** In this task, participants will be asked to examine the retrieval effectiveness when the test documents are dated within a 2 months period from the documents available in the train collection.\
**Sub-task B, long-term persistence.** In this task, participants will be asked to examine retrieval effectiveness on the documents published after at least 3 months after the documents in the train collection were published.
